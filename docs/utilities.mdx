# Utilities

On top of providing [initialization](initialize) APIs, the `knee-runtime` package contains a thin layer of utilities
wrapping the [JNI APIs](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/jni/spec/functions.html) in a way
that's more comfortable to Kotlin users.

> The `knee-runtime` package is automatically added to your project by the Gradle Plugin.

## Environment and Virtual Machine

We define two handy typealiases for the common JNI entry points, `*JNIEnv` and `*JavaVM`:

```kotlin
typealias JniEnvironment = CPointer<JNIEnvVar>
typealias JavaVirtualMachine = CPointer<JavaVMVar>
```

At any point after Knee [initialization](initialize), you can:

- fetch the machine with `val machine = io.deepmedia.tools.knee.runtime.currentJavaVirtualMachine`
- fetch the machine's environment with `val environment = machine.env`.

Due to JNI design, the machine's environment will only be non-null if it was previously attached to the current thread.
You can attach and detach the environment using regular JNI APIs, or use the `useEnv { }` utility:

```kotlin
val jvm = currentJavaVirtualMachine
jvm.useEnv { environment ->
    // useEnv attaches the current thread, and detaches it later
    // unless an environment was already available, in which case it does no attach/detach
}
```

## API wrappers

Most JNI APIs are available as extension functions to `JniEnvironment` and `JavaVirtualMachine`.
These function generally respect the original name and semantics, avoiding I/O conversions. For example:

- `JniEnvironment.getBooleanField()` returns a `jboolean`, not a `Boolean`
- `JniEnvironment.newIntArray()` returns a `jintArray`, not an `IntArray`

This design choice stems from the hope that, when using Knee, you shouldn't need to deal with JNI APIs at all,
so the wrappers can be more performant by avoiding opinionated conversions.

The only exception to this rule is, well, **exceptions**: our wrappers automatically check return codes to be `JNI_OK`
and, where appropriate, invoke `ExceptionCheck`, `ExceptionOccurred`, `ExceptionClear`, and throw a `Throwable`.

As an example, this is how, given an environment, you may create a JVM object and invoke a function on it.

```kotlin
fun getClassFieldOrThrow(env: JniEnvironment): Long {
    val objectClass: jclass = env.findClass("com/example/MyClass")
    val objectConstructor: jmethodID = env.getMethodID(objectClass, "<init>", "()V")
    val objectInstance: jobject = env.newObject(objectClass, objectConstructor)

    val fieldMethod: jmethodID = env.getFieldId(objectClass, "myField", "J")
    val fieldValue: Long = env.getLongField(objectInstance, fieldMethod)
    return fieldValue
}
```
