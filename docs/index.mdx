# Intro

Knee is a Kotlin compiler plugin and companion runtime tools that provides seamless communication between Kotlin/Native
binaries and Kotlin/JVM, using a thin and efficient layer around the JNI interface.

With Knee, you can write idiomatic Kotlin/Native code, annotate it and then invoke it transparently from JVM
as if they were running on the same environment.

For a brief overview of Knee's capabilities and to see sample code, we recommend checking the [features](features) page
where you'll learn about all supported features such as:

- Ability to call [functions](features/callables#functions), get or set [properties](features/callables#properties) across JNI
- [Suspend functions](features/suspend-functions) with two-way cancellation, holding structured concurrency together
- [Exception support](features/exceptions), including custom exception types
- Built-in serialization of [language primitives](features/builtin-types#primitives): numbers, strings, nullables, `Unit`, `Nothing`
- Built-in serialization of [collection types](features/builtin-types#collections): lists, sets, efficient arrays
- Serialization of [enums](features/enums), [classes](features/classes) and [objects](features/objects)
- Serialization of [interfaces](features/interfaces) for two-way invocations
- Lambdas and [generics](features/interfaces#importing-interfaces) support
- [No-copy buffers](features/buffers), mapping `java.nio` buffers to `CPointer` on native
