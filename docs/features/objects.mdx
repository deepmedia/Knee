# Objects

## Annotating objects

Whenever you declare an object, you can use the `@KneeObject` annotation to tell the compiler that it should be processed.
Knee supports objects in different scenarios:

- top level objects
- objects nested inside another declaration
- `companion` objects

```kotlin
@KneeObject object Foo {
    ...
}

class Utilities {
    @KneeObject object Bar { ... }
    @KneeObject companion object { ... }
}
```

Under the hood, objects are *not* actually serialized and passed through the JNI interface: since there can only be a single
instance of an object, no extra information is needed and the compiler can retrieve the object field statically on both
platforms.

## Annotating members

All callable members (functions, properties, constructors) of an object can be made available to the JVM side, but
they must be explicitly marked with the `@Knee` annotation as described in the [callables](callables) documentation.

```kotlin
@KneeObject object Game {
    @Knee fun start() { ... }
    fun loop() { ... }
}
```

In the example above, only the `start` function will be available on the JVM side.

## Importing objects

If you wish to annotate existing objects that you don't control, for example those coming from a different module,
you can technically use `@KneeObject` on type aliases. Unfortunately as of now, this functionality is very limited in that you
can't choose which declarations will be imported.
