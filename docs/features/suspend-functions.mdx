# Suspend Functions

## Declaration

All [functions](callables#functions) that support the `@Knee` annotation can also be marked as `suspend`.
The developer UX is exactly the same:

```kotlin
// Kotlin/Native
@Knee suspend fun computeNumber(): Int = coroutineScope {
    val num1 = async { loadFirstNumber() }
    val num2 = async { loadSecondNumber() }
    num1.await() + num2.await()
}

// Kotlin/JVM
scope.launch {
    val number = computeNumber()
    println("Found number: $number")
}
```

## Structured concurrency

The underlying implementation is very complex in order to support two-way cancellation and error propagation.
In the example above:

- If the JVM `scope` is cancelled, the native coroutines are also cancelled
- If the native coroutines are cancelled, `computeNumber` throws a `CancellationException`
- Errors are propagated up/down and the exception type, if possible, is [preserved](exceptions)

In short, calling a `@Knee` suspend function is no different than calling a local suspend function
and you can expect the same level of support. In particular Knee preserves the hierarchy of coroutines
and keeps them connected across the JNI bridge.

##### Context elements

Knee does no attempt at preserving the `CoroutineContext`. All context element, most notably the `CoroutineDispatcher`,
will be lost when the JNI bridge is crossed:

- `@Knee` suspend functions called from K/JVM are invoked on `Dispatchers.Unconfined` on the native backend
- `@Knee` suspend functions called from K/N are invoked on `Dispatchers.Unconfined` on the JVM frontend
