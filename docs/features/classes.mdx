# Classes

## Annotating classes

Whenever you declare a class, you can use the `@KneeClass` annotation to tell the
compiler that it should be processed. This has a few implications that are important to understand.

```kotlin
@KneeClass class Item(@Knee val id: String)

@KneeClass class Database @Knee constructor(path: String) {
   private val directory = Directory(path)

   @Knee fun loadItems(): List<Item> { ... }
}
```

#### JVM wrappers

When a class is marked as `@KneeClass`, the compiler generates source code for the JVM in which the same class exists,
but is **a wrapper** to the underlying native instance. Using the `Database` example above, the generated JVM class
may look something like this:

```kotlin
class Database internal constructor(private val native: Long) {
    constructor(path: String) : this(native = NativeDatabase_init(path))
    fun loadItems(): List<Item> = NativeDatabase_loadItems(native)
    protected fun finalize() = NativeDatabase_deinit(native)
}
```

You can see that:

- JVM's `Database` is just a wrapper around the native `Database` instance, holding onto its native address (a `Long`)
- When JVM's `Database` is garbage collected, the native instance is notified to avoid leaks

> You can use `@KneeClass(name = "OtherName")` to modify the JVM wrapper name.

#### Pass by reference

It may be useful to know that `@KneeClass` objects are passed through the JNI interface using the above mentioned
`Long` address, by reference. This means that **no data is being copied**: the source of truth remains on the native side,
and JVM users can easily invoke its functions and use its properties thanks to Knee.

#### JVM construction

While **the source of truth of a class is always on the native side**, you can still let JVM users create new instances.
This must be done explicitly by annotating one or more of the class constructors with the `@Knee` annotation.

```kotlin
@KneeClass class Post(@Knee val id: String)
@KneeClass class User @Knee constructor(@Knee val id: String)
```

In the example above, `Post` can't be instantiated from the JVM side, while `User` can.

> Even if JVM users can create instances, that doesn't mean that data lives on the JVM side. Simply, the JVM class constructor
> will call the native class constructor under the hood, and store a reference to it.

## Annotating members

All callable members (functions, properties, constructors) of a class can be made available to the JVM side, but
they must be explicitly marked with the `@Knee` annotation as described in the [callables](callables) documentation.

```kotlin
@KneeClass class Car {
    @Knee fun driveHome() { ... }
    fun driveWork() { ... }
}
```

In the example above, only the `driveHome` function will be available on the JVM side.

## Importing classes

If you wish to annotate existing classes that you don't control, for example those coming from a different module,
you can technically use `@KneeClass` on type aliases. Unfortunately as of now, this functionality is very limited in that you
can't choose which declarations will be imported.
