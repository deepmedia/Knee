# Exceptions

Whenever a `@Knee` [callable](../callables) throws, the exception is thrown on the other side of the bridge.

```kotlin
// Kotlin/Native
@Knee fun throwSomething() {
    error("Something went wrong")
}

// Kotlin/JVM
val failure = runCatching { throwSomething() }.exceptionOrNull()
checkNotNull(failure)
check(failure.message == "Something went wrong")
```

## Transparency

By default, exceptions are not serializable and can't pass the JNI bridge (a `jthrowable` is not a `Throwable`!).
However, Knee strives to represents exception in the most transparent way, by reconstructing them with appropriate type
and parameters.

##### Message preservation

Whenever possible, the exception `message` is preserved, as can be seen in the example above.

##### Type preservation

Some common types are preserved. For example, a `kotlin.coroutines.cancellation.CancellationException` in the backend
will be re-thrown as a `java.util.concurrent.CancellationException` in the frontend.

##### Instance preservation

In some occasions, especially when lambdas are involved, the same exception can cross the JNI interface twice.
Consider the following example:

```kotlin
// Native
@KneeInterface typealias StringMapper = (String) -> String

@Knee fun mapString(source: String, mapper: StringMapper): String {
    return mapper(source)
}
```

The JVM consumer code may try to `mapString`, but throw an exception:

```kotlin
mapString("Hello") { throw IllegalStateException("Something went wrong") }
```

In this scenario, the `IllegalStateException` is thrown from the JVM, rethrown on the K/N side when invoking `mapper`,
and finally rethrown on the JVM side when `mapString` returns. That exception will be **exactly the same instance**,
meaning that you could check they're the same with `===`.

While this may seem useless, many commonly used functions (notably, `Flow.collectWhile`) rely on these
checks and can only work when such mechanism is in place.

## Custom exceptions

You may also use custom exceptions, as long as they were properly annotated as [classes](../classes).

```kotlin
@KneeClass
class CustomException @Knee constructor(message: String) : RuntimeException(message) {
    @Knee
    override val message: String? get() = super.message
}
```

Whenever a `CustomException` is thrown inside a Knee invocation, the runtime serializes it and creates a copy
for the other side of the JNI interface! You can also annotate other functions or properties for them to be exposed to JVM.
