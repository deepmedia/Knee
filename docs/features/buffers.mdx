# Buffers

## Definition

When dealing with memory and buffers, you may at some point need to pass them through the Native/JVM interface
efficiently by reference, avoiding copies especially as their size grows.

Knee provides a built-in solution for this problem based on `java.nio` direct buffers and their native counterparts
defined by the `knee-runtime` package. You can use:

- A direct `java.nio.ByteBuffer` on the JVM and `io.deepmedia.tools.knee.runtime.buffer.ByteBuffer` on native;
- A direct `java.nio.DoubleBuffer` on the JVM and `io.deepmedia.tools.knee.runtime.buffer.DoubleBuffer` on native;
- A direct `java.nio.FloatBuffer` on the JVM and `io.deepmedia.tools.knee.runtime.buffer.FloatBuffer` on native;
- A direct `java.nio.IntBuffer` on the JVM and `io.deepmedia.tools.knee.runtime.buffer.IntBuffer` on native;
- A direct `java.nio.LongBuffer` on the JVM and `io.deepmedia.tools.knee.runtime.buffer.LongBuffer` on native.

Whenever such buffers are used as parameters or return types for Knee functions, the runtime will convert between the two.

### Memory leaks

Native buffers are just thin wrappers around a `CPointer`. Should you choose to allocate such buffers on the native side
(see [examples](#examples)), you **must free them after use**, using `buffer.free()`.

> Natively allocated buffers are usable on the JVM only until the `buffer.free()` call

This requirement is lifted when buffers are allocated on the JVM side and passed down. In this case, buffers will
keep a strong reference to the `java.nio.ByteBuffer`, so memory will be reclaimed only when all buffers (on both sides!)
go out of scope and are garbage collected.

## Examples

##### Allocate on JVM, pass down

```kotlin
// JVM
val buffer = java.nio.ByteBuffer.allocateDirect(1024)
fillBuffer(buffer)

// Native
@Knee fun fillBuffer(buffer: io.deepmedia.tools.knee.runtime.buffer.ByteBuffer) {
    check(buffer.size == 1024)
    val rawPointer: CArrayPointer<ByteVar> = buffer.ptr
    // Fill rawPointer...
}
```

##### Allocate natively, pass up

```kotlin
// JVM
useBuffer(1024) { buffer: java.nio.ByteBuffer ->
   check(buffer.capacity == 1024)
   // Use it...
}

// Native
@Knee fun useBuffer(size: Int, block: (io.deepmedia.tools.knee.runtime.buffer.ByteBuffer) -> Unit) {
    val environment = currentJavaVirtualMachine.env!!
    val buffer = io.deepmedia.tools.knee.runtime.buffer.ByteBuffer(environment, size)
    try {
        block(buffer)
    } finally {
        buffer.free()
    }
}
```
