# Interfaces

## Annotating interfaces

> We recommend reading the [classes](classes) documentation first.

Whenever you declare an interface, you can use the `@KneeInterface` annotation to tell the
compiler that it should be processed.

```kotlin
@KneeClass class Image(val contents: String)

@KneeInterface interface ImageUploadCallbacks {
   fun imageUploadStarted(image: Image)
   fun imageUploadCompleted(image: Image)
}
```

Since the interface is declared on the native side but not available on the JVM, a copy of the declaration
will be generated for the JVM sources.

> You can use `@KneeInterface(name = "OtherName")` to modify the JVM name.

## Two-way implementation

Unlike [classes](classes), where the implementation of members is done on the Kotlin Native side and the JVM instance
is just a wrapper around it, `@KneeInterface` interface allow implementation from both sides. This makes it a much more
powerful tool! You can do either of the following:

- Implement the interface natively, and pass it to the JVM. You will receive a thin JVM wrapper around the native interface
- Implement the interface on the JVM, and pass it to Kotlin Native. You will receive a thin native wrapper around the JVM interface

For example, the code below is perfectly fine:


```kotlin
// Kotlin/Native
@Knee fun uploadImage(image: Image, callbacks: ImageUploadCallbacks) {
    // ... downward call
}
```

But you may also implement interfaces natively and expose them:

```kotlin
// Kotlin/Native
@KneeInterface interface ImageFactory {
    fun createImage(): Image
}

@Knee val DefaultImageFactory: ImageFactory = object: ImageFactory {
    override fun createImage(): Image = // ... upward call
}
```

With this setup, the JVM code could do:

```kotlin
// Kotlin/JVM
val image: Image = DefaultImageFactory.createImage() // K/JVM calls a K/N interface
uploadImage(image, object : ImageUploadCallbacks { // K/JVM interface called by K/N
    override fun imageUploadStarted(image: Image) { ... }
    override fun imageUploadCompleted(image: Image) { ... }
})
```

## Annotating members

Annotating callable members (functions, properties) of an interface **is not needed**. By default, all declarations
that are part of the interface contract will be marked as exported as if you added the `@Knee` annotation.

## Importing interfaces

If you wish to annotate existing interfaces that you don't control, for example those coming from a different module,
note that you can use `@KneeInterface` on type aliases. For example:

```kotlin
@KneeInterface typealias MyInterface = SomeExternalInterface
```

You can now use `MyInterface` as a value parameter or return type of Knee functions, and pass it both ways.

### Lambdas

The most common use-case for imported interfaces is lambdas. In the Kotlin language, lambdas and suspend lambdas
extend the types `FunctionN` and `SuspendFunctionN`, where N is the number of function arguments.

Luckily, you don't have to refer to these types and can use the lambda syntax directly:

```kotlin
@KneeInterface typealias ImageMerger = (Image, Image) -> Image
@KneeInterface typealias ImageFetcher = suspend (String) -> Image?

@Knee suspend fun mergeImages(fetcher: ImageFetcher, id1: String, id2: String, merger: ImageMerger): Image {
    val image1 = fetcher(id1) ?: error("Not found")
    val image2 = fetcher(id2) ?: error("Not found")
    return merger(image1, image2)
}
```

> It is recommended to keep lambda typealiases `private`. Typealiases won't be available on the JVM.

### Generics

You may have noticed at this point that the import syntax (`@KneeInterface typealias ...`) supports generics,
something which regular interfaces (`@KneeInterface interface ...`) don't.

The ability to specialize interfaces is not restricted to external declarations. Just declare a typealias to your own interface:

```kotlin
interface EntityCallback<T> {
    fun entityCreated(entity: T)
    fun entityDeleted(entity: T)
}

@KneeInterface typealias ImageCallback = EntityCallback<Image>
```

You can now use `EntityCallback<Image>` as a value parameter or return type of Knee functions.

### Example: flows

A notable example of interface imports and generics, is the ability to import kotlinx's `Flow`.

```kotlin
// Kotlin/Native
@KneeInterface private typealias ImagesFlow = Flow<List<Image>>
@KneeInterface private typealias ImagesFlowCollector = FlowCollector<List<Image>>

@Knee fun loadImages(): Flow<List<Image>>> = ...

// Kotlin/JVM
suspend fun loadImage(id: String): Flow<Image?> {
   return loadImages().map { list ->
       list.firstOrNull { image -> image.id == id }
   }
}
```

Note that since `Flow<T>` refers to `FlowCollector<T>`, we must also manually import the collector as well.

You may use the same strategy to import `StateFlow`, `SharedFlow`, their `Mutable*` version, or really any other
interface that you can think of, as long as all types are correctly imported.
