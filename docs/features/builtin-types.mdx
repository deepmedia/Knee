# Built-in types

Whenever [callables](callables) are declared, Knee compiler's task is being able to serialize and deserialize,
both on the backend and on the frontend:

- function arguments, or the property type for setters
- the function return type, or the property type for getters

By default, Knee provides built-in support for many commonly used types, and utilities to define others
(for example, [enums](enums), [classes](classes), [interfaces](interfaces)) and even import external declarations.

## Primitives

Most "primitive" language types are automatically supported:

- `Int` and `UInt`
- `Long` and `ULong`
- `Byte` and `UByte`
- `Float`
- `Double`
- `Boolean`
- `String`

So the following example works out of the box:

```kotlin
@Knee fun sumAndDescribe(arg1: Int, arg2: Float, arg3: ULong): String {
   val result = arg1.toDouble() + arg2.toDouble() + arg3.toLong().toDouble()
   return result.toString()
}
```

## Special return types

`Unit` and `Nothing` are also supported when used as return types.

## Nullable types

For any type `T` - both built-ins and types annotated by the developer - Knee is also able to serialize their nullable version `T?`.
Note that for primitive values, this comes at the well known cost of **boxing**. In the following example:

```kotlin
@Knee fun countOrNull(): Int? {
   return if (list.isEmpty()) null else list.size
}
```
The `Int?` return type will be passed as a `java.lang.Integer` / `jobject`, not a simple `jint`.

## Collections

For any type `T` - both built-ins and types annotated by the developer - Knee is also able to serialize some of the
collection types which use `T` as their element type.

For example, since `Int` is serializable, Knee can also serialize:
- `IntArray`
- `List<Int>`
- `Set<Int>`

As you may, the performance of these options is not the same because the `IntArray` signature avoids boxing.

> In case of non-primitive values, `Array<Type>` will be used. That may still perform better than `List` or `Set`,
> although not dramatically better.
