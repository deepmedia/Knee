# Callables

We refer to functions and properties as *callables*. When appropriately annotated, callables can be invoked from
either side of the JNI interface (frontend or backend), execute your code on the other side and return some value.

## Functions

For a function to be available on the JVM side, it must be annotated with the `@Knee` annotation.
We support top-level functions and functions nested in `@KneeClass` declarations, as you can learn in [classes](classes).
Upward functions (called from K/N, implemented on the JVM) are also available through [interfaces](interfaces).

```kotlin
// Kotlin/Native
@Knee fun topLevelFunction(): Int {
    return 42
}

// Kotlin/JVM
check(topLevelFunction() == 42)
```

## Properties

For a property to be available on the JVM side, it must be annotated with the `@Knee` annotation.
We support top-level properties and properties nested in `@KneeClass` declarations, as you can learn in [classes](classes).
Upward properties (called from K/N, implemented on the JVM) are also available through [interfaces](interfaces).

Both `var` and `val` properties are supported.

```kotlin
// Kotlin/Native
@Knee val immutableProp: Int = 42
@Knee var mutableProp: Int = 0

// Kotlin/JVM
mutableProp = immutableProp
check(mutableProp == immutableProp)
```
