# Enums

## Annotating enums

Enums can be easily serialized through their ordinal value. You can use the `@KneeEnum` annotation to tell the
compiler that:

- this native enum is expected to be serialized, so a JVM clone must be generated
- the compiler must serialize and deserialize these types whenever they are part of a [callable](callables) declaration, e.g. a function argument or return type

In the following example:

```kotlin
@KneeEnum enum class DayOfWeek {
    Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
}

@Knee fun getCurrentDay(): DayOfWeek = ...
```

Your JVM code can retrieve the current day with `getCurrentDay()` and receive a valid `DayOfWeek` instance back.
If you wish to have a different JVM name, use the name parameter:

```kotlin
// Kotlin/Native
@KneeEnum(name = "WeekDay") enum class DayOfWeek { ... }

// Kotlin/JVM
val currentDay: WeekDay = getCurrentDay()
```

## Importing enums

If you wish to annotate existing enums that you don't control, for example those coming from a different module,
note that you can use `@KneeEnum` on type aliases. For example:

```kotlin
@KneeEnum typealias DeprecationLevel = kotlin.DeprecationLevel
@KneeEnum typealias BufferOverflow = kotlinx.coroutines.channels.BufferOverflow
```

If the declaration is not found on the frontend, a clone will be generated, otherwise the existing declaration will be used.
