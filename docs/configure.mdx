  Check out all available options to configure Knee Gradle Plugin, like verbosity, output directories and automatic
  target connection in Kotlin Multiplatform projects.

# Configuration

Like installation, configuration of Knee settings is done via the Gradle Plugin and Gradle properties.
The plugin will install an extension named `knee` with the following options:

## Verbosity

```kotlin
knee {
    verboseLogs.set(true) // default: false
    verboseRuntime.set(true) // default: false
    verboseSources.set(true) // default: false
}
```

These three options should be used for debugging. They may also be controlled via a property in `gradle.properties`,
using the syntax `io.deepmedia.knee.<propName>=<true|false>`.

- `verboseLogs`: if enabled, the Gradle plugin will print logs to the terminal.
- `verboseRuntime`: if enabled, the compiler plugin will inject `println()` calls at runtime for debugging.
- `verboseSources`: if enabled, the generated frontend source files will include comments and extra elements to understand which code generated them.

## Source Sets

> In multiplatform projects with both backend and frontend targets,
> you can ignore this and just use [automatic target connection](#target-connection).

As described in [the concepts page](concepts), Knee analyzes your native code and generates JVM sources.
These sources must be consumed somehow (e.g. added to your source sets).

To retrieve and configure the directory, use:

```kotlin
knee {
    generatedSourceDirectory.get() // default dir is build/knee/src
    generatedSourceDirectory.set(layout.buildDirectory.map { it.dir("somethingElse") })

    val targetSpecificDir = generatedSourceDirectory(myKotlinTarget)
}
```

Note that the `generatedSourceDirectory` is a root directory, with one subfolder per each `KotlinNativeTarget`
where Knee is applied.

## Target Connection

In Android Multiplatform projects, Knee will try to automatically bind backends with frontends:

- Determine all `androidNative` targets
- Declare debug and release binaries for them
- Pack the binaries in a dedicated folder (`build/knee/bin`) respecting Android's `jniLibs` convention
- Add such folder to Android Gradle Plugin and link tasks accordingly
- Add `knee.generatedSourceDirectory` to Android Gradle Plugin source sets and link tasks accordingly

This can be disabled by using `knee.connectTargets.set(true)`.
